# Universal_Scaling_Law_for_Safe_Prime
We establish an exact multiplicative formula for the number of residue classes modulo primorials that can represent safe primes. Specifically, we prove that when extending a primorial Pn by a new prime p, the count of safe-prime-admissible residues scales by the factor (p-2).
